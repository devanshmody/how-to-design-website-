<font size="6px">Notice:</font>If you have a Gmail email, please check your Spam / Junk folder, because Gmail is INFAMOUS / NOTORIOUS for sending legitimate emails to the Spam / Junk folder.  This is fact.  This is reality.  This is our terrible experience with Gmail.  And this can also happen with Yahoo accounts sometimes.  We have to explain this to people every single day, and it is quite frustrating.<br>
