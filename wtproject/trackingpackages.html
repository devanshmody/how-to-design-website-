<p> Yes, we can provide tracking only if the order was shipped with UPS, however you will need to wait at least 2 days after placing your order, because it takes at least 24 hours to ship out your order, then another day or two before we can get a tracking number.  Don't assume we use UPS, because most of the time we don't.  Most medium size and small size items are shipped with by Mail, so you will only have a Delivery Confirmation number instead of a "tracking" number.  In most cases, we do not automatically e-mail tracking numbers and/or Delivery Confirmation #'s, we basically just ship out the order, so if you need help with your tracking information, you are welcomed to e-mail us your request or call us if you need to,<a href="file:///C:/Users/dell/Desktop/wtproject/contactus.html">contact us</a><br>

<font size="4px">Notice:-</font><br>Practically 80% of our shipments are 1st Class Mail, which comes in your mailbox with the rest of your mail.  We ship almost everything in small shipping envelopes, even nunchucks are shipped in large envelopes which will come and fit in your mailbox with the rest of your mail.  Delivery Confirmation doesn't let you track the detailed progress of all the location scans like UPS, nor does it tell you the expected delivery date like UPS.  There is a difference, and it's not very hard to understand this difference!
We request that you use only one address on your order, simply because we have experienced too much credit card fraud with people using 2 different addresses for Billing and Shipping.  It's just a fact in Internet commerce. Think about it... a credit card thief is forced to put the correct Billing address in order for the purchase to be authorized, but of course they try to have the order shipped to themselves at some other address.  So you can see where the problem lies. Also, in our industry, since we sell weapons, we also have a problem with many teenagers using their parent's credit cards and having the stuff shipped to their friend's house. So, quite frankly we are just sick and tired of Credit Card Fraud and minors trying to buy weapons, so we are strict about customers using two different addresses. 
<font size="2px" color="#FF0000">If you use two different address for Shipping and Billing, your order will be delayed and somebody will contact you by e-mail.
